## OMG, You're Famous. #blog

Create a simple blog using Rails, it should allow visitors to view a list of posts, create thier own post, or update an existing post. There should be no way to delete a post via the web interface. A post should consist of a title and body.

We'll look for the following things:

- A PostsController, which allows anyone to list, create, or update posts.
- An appropriately restricted route given the PostsController actions.
- A test suite
- Visual style is not terribly important, but we ask that fields and lists of posts aren't just jumbled together
